# 🚀 Contributing to Minnasoft Projects

Minnasoft is a collective of developers&mdash;problem solvers&mdash;who develop solutions that are:

1. Simple
2. Effective
3. Fun

We optimize for **sustainability** (of both systems, and people), because good software should come from teams that feel alive, curious, and unburdened!
